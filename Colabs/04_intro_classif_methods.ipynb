It is therefore a prediction of a qualitative or categorical variable.<br>For example: to determine if an *email* must be classified as *clean* or *spam* from information on the email, such as the object, the body of the text, the presence of hypertext link etc ...<br><br>\n",">> In a classification problem, *labels* can be of two kinds:\n",">>>* **ordinal** When the classes are naturally ordered between them.
