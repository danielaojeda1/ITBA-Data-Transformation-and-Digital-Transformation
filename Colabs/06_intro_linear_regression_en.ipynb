All of these concepts will be presented in more detail and put into practice in the modules dedicated to Machine Learning.\n",">\n","> Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn how to automatically perform tasks based on data. When the task to be performed is the prediction of a variable, we refer to this as supervised learning.\n",">\n","> Linear regression is one of the first predictive models of supervised learning to have been studied. This model allows us to predict a quantitative variable. Today, it is the most popular model for practical applications due to its simplicity.\n",">\n","> In the linear regression model, we have $y$, the quantitative variable to be predicted (called the target variable), and explanatory variables that enable prediction.\n","\n","### Univariate Linear Regression\n","\n","> In the univariate linear model, we have two variables, $y$ called the target variable and $x$ called the explanatory variable. <br>\n","> Linear regression consists of modeling the relationship between these two variables using an affine function. Thus, the formula for the univariate linear model is given by:\n","> $$y \\approx \\beta_1 x + \\beta_0 $$\n","> where:\n",">> * $y$ is the variable we want to predict.\n",">>\n",">>\n",">> * $x$ is the explanatory variable.\n",">>\n",">>\n",">> * $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$ are the parameters of the linear function. $\\beta_1$ will define its **slope** and $\\beta_0$ will define its y-intercept (also called **bias**).\n",">\n","> **The goal of linear regression is to estimate the best parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ to predict the variable $y$ from a given value of $x$**.\n",">\n","> To get a feel for univariate linear regression, let's look at the interactive example below.\n","\n","* **(a)** Run the following cell to display the interactive figure.
